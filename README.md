1. Install the dependencies for our code using Conda. You may need to adjust the environment YAML file depending on your setup.

```
    source ~/.bashrc
```
```
    chmod +x run_unlab_sweep.sh
./run_unlab_sweep.sh

```
3. Run the following code for our main experiments.
```
     git checkout -- run_unlab_sweep.sh   
    git pull origin main                 

```
## Our code is based on Garg's work
